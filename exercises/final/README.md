# Final Project#

My idea for my game is to make a downhill chair surfing game (this could totally change as I think about it more but I think thus could be fun)

## Gameplay

The entire game takes places on a downhill slope filled with office chairs. The chairs are rolling down the slope. As the player, you are trying to survive on the chairs for as long as possible. When a player is on a chair, they will be spinning (because it's an office chair), and eventually will have to jump off in the direction of another office chair. The direction they jump will be decided by the direction that the chair is facing. The game is over when the player does not land on another office chair. If a player is on a single chair for too long it will break.


## Input##

This game will require very little input from the player. Mainly, the space bar will be used to jump and the arrow keys will give some control in the air as well as the rotation of the office chairs.

## Visual Style##

I want this tp both show the dreariness of offices and also the fun of office chair surfing, as this is supposed to be an escape of sorts. because of that, I want the main palatte to focus on black and white, with black chairs on a white (maybe gray) slope, and the character hopefully being someone in a suit (we'll see what I can find on Google Poly). As the game goes on, I would like the colors to become more interesting by changing the color of the slope and/or chairs the further the player gets

## Audio##

I haven't touched audio yet in Unity, so as long as I can just have audio, that's all I'm really aiming for. Ideally there would be game music, and specific sound effects for jumping, landing, and failing.


## Interface

Gimme a minute to figure this one out. I'm trying my best!

Generally, it will include a score counter, chair strength indicator, and potentially a power up status indicator if I can get that in. Outside of gameplay, there will be a start screen, and potentially a shop for players to spend their coins. I need to figure out how to do all of that though. 


## Story/Theme

Like I said earlier, the theme of this game is escape from the mundane, taking everyday objects and making them fun. There isn't to much of a story. I see this as more of a mobile game that you play for a day or two before deleting it because there are too many ads.


# Feature Sets

## Low Bar##

A complete game would feature a totally workable chair surfing mechanic that is "fun" and complete. This means that the jumping works as expected, chairs act as expected, game objects spawn and despawn correctly, and a score counter for people to track their high scores. Ideally this will be an endless game, but I dont know how hard that will be to implement (So endless runner might change which target set its under depending on how hard it is, but it's definitelly something I want).


## Target##

My expectation is that I can complete all the above, as well as add powerups to the game like a bubble that lets the player bounce on the track withought needing the chairs, a magnet which attracts chairs, or a speedboost. I also want to have some kind of coins that the player can collect which will help them boost their score.


## High Bar ##

If everything goes well, I would like to expand on the coin system so that players can buy upgrades. This would include increased stats like a higher jump or a longer time to stay on a chair before it breaks (or they fall off, I havent really figured out exactly what that will look like.)

I also would like to add the possibility for different chairs to spawn, which could have increased stats over the traditional office chairs. Players could buy the chance for this to happen more often.

## Extreme ##

If everything goes well or if it turns out some of this is really ease and/or impossible for me, another goal of mine is to add environmental hazards. Generally I don't want the player to worry about falling off the ramp/slope, but I want the chairs to be able to fall off, so there will be a railing keeping the player on but letting chairs out underneath (this is part of my low-target area feature sets). I would also like to add sections where the railing dissappears so the player is in more danger. I would also like to play with ramps and pits to see if thats someting I can work with. I have a feeling this will be difficult when adding this to the endless runner aspect of the game.
