## Game Concept

Basically, my idea for my game is to make an isometric (duh) puzzle game revolving around building your character and then depositing bits of the playable character in order to solve puzzles. A concept for one puzzle is to collect collect a piece, then to drop that piece into a hole so that the playable character is able to cross a gap.

## Implementation

In order to have the player and its conjoined parts move how they are intended, any conjoined objects will become a child of the player object.


## Features

My goal is to create 2-3 puzzles/levels. Features I want to implement are:

* Detach pieces when they are above a gap
* Be able to combine and detach block with a mouse click
* a rotation peice, that allows a block to rotate and reorient itself (rotation is otherwise not something I intend to be a part of the Game)
* Jump pad that can launch that playable character into the air. The player will otherwise be unable to jump
